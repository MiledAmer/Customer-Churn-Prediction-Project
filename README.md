# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning. It follows a modular structure to ensure reproducibility and scalability. 
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and build a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to identify customers at risk of leaving.

## 2. Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset `dataset.csv`.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each step of the pipeline.
- `utils/`: Helper scripts for preprocessing and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 3. Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository per your git setup.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   ./venv/Scripts/activate
   # Mac/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
